# artful-cli

## Goals

- Allow me to post new images to my art site easily, with everything being tracked automatically
  instead of me having to enter separate entries to add one image
- It should fill in the blanks or ask for details where it can't derive them.
- It should track details and be able to derive them
  - top index
  - categories
  - last used
- details tracked in text files, ideally
- it should allow me to make NFTs from images I've published to Artful.one - Allowing me to edit descriptions there, and then push to NFT/IPFS.
